# Terraform module to Create New AWS Account on AWS Organizations
Provides a resource to create a member account in the current organization.

```
WARNING: Deleting this Terraform resource will only remove an AWS account from an organization. Terraform will not close the account. The member account must be prepared to be a standalone account beforehand. See the AWS Organizations documentation for more information.
```

The `create_account` block has the following attributes as required:

- `account_name`: the name of the new aws account that will be created.
- `email`: the account email of the new aws account.
- `iam_role_name`: the name of an IAM role that Organizations automatically preconfigures in the new member account.
- `organizational_unit`: parent Organizational Unit ID or Root ID for the account. Defaults to the Organization default Root ID.
- `iam_user_access_to_billing`: enables IAM users to access account billing information if they have the required permissions.
- `default_tags`: Key-value map of resource tags.
